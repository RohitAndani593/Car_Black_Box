The Car Black Box project involves developing a device that records critical vehicle data such as 
speed, GPS location, and camera footage to assist in accident analysis, driver monitoring, and safety 
improvements. It integrates sensors, secure storage, and connectivity features to provide real-time 
alerts, data retrieval, and remote access.
